 Given the proper education, with necessary care and
guidance right from the childhood, one can surely be
successful in the future. There are a number of children
whose parents struggle hard everyday to provide a basic
education to their children with a hope of building
a better future for them. Most of the children with indigent background study in the government schools without access to the basic needs like notebooks and stationery. NoteBook Drive (NBD), IISc nurtures their willingness to learn by providing the necessary amenities like
notebooks, stationery, geometry equipment, crayons etc.
at the beginning of each academic year.
